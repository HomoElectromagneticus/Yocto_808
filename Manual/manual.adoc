Press *START* to listen select pattern.

Press *MUTE*. Mute led is blinking. Press one of the 16 steps buttons (1 is the accent, 2 the bassdrum, 3 the snaredrum...) to mute them. Press again to unmute. *PUSH ENCODER* unmute all instruments.

=== Pattern Din Sync
Same as *"Pattern Mode"* but with the sync slaved to external Sync24. In this mode Yocto is waiting for a DIN clock signal.

Press *START*. Select an instrument with *INST SELECTOR* and edit steps you want to trig current instruments.
Press *SCALE* to change scale. (1/32, 1/16, 1/16t or 1/8).

If pattern is more than 16 steps, first part and second part switch automatically. If you want to switch them manually push *1-16 BUTTON* and *17-32 BUTTON together*.
When sequencer is running you can clear current step of selected drum with a *PUSH ENCODER*.

== Midi Dump
This mode allows you to make a backup of all pattern data by dumping it as Midi SysEx. This was not part of the original Yocto feature set, so it is not indicated on the front panel. You can find Midi Dump mode on the empty rotary *switch position 10*, right under INIT.
To dump the complete pattern memory of the Yocto, start your external midi recorder, then press *START*. An animation will indicate going over 16 patterns per 16 banks. Another animation will be shown when done.

== Midi Restore
This mode allows you to restore previously backed up pattern data to the Yocto's internal memory. As this was not part of the original Yocto feature set, it is not indicated on the front panel. You can find Midi Restore mode on the empty rotary *switch position 9*, under Midi Dump, left of Expander.
In this mode, the Yocto is always ready to receive patterns in SysEx format. As soon as you start sending the external data, LED animations will show which pattern/bank we are receiving.

== Expander
Select Input MIDI channel with steps buttons. To assign Midi note, select an instrument with *INST SELECTOR*, hold *SHIFT* and send the MIDI note you want to trig the current select instrument (Midi note are hold in the EEprom). Mute led indicate Midi activity.

== SysEx Sofware Update
To update Yocto software, turn off Yocto then turn on while holding step button 1, 3, 5. All steps leds will blink two times.
Yocto are now waiting for Sysex. We recommended MIDI-OX as Sysex loader. (http://www.midiox.com//[www.midiox.com^])

To know your Yocto software version, select Init EEP mode and press *RESET*, you will hear two kick that indicate you are in version 2.0
